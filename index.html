        This is a demonstration of live decoding of the voyager record. This page was created by Malte Gruber.
        The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/MalteGruberPrivate/voyager-record-decoder">here.</a>
        
        <h2>What is going on?</h2>
        This page loads a .mp3 file that was created by reading a copy of the voyager record and which can be found <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-482195982/voyager-golden-record-encoded-images">here</a>.
        Your browser runs some code that translates the audio recording of the record to an image. The phonograph records have two channels, left and right. These channels hold different sets of images which are displayed in the left and right windows. A time domain representation of the signal is shown as an oscilloscope picture, it matches the newest line of the image. Some images are replicated three times and represent the red, green and blue channels of the picture. I have not implemented a way of combining these, this was just a quick weekend project that turned out to be pretty neat.
